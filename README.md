# CEP Svelte Starter

This is a simple starter for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) in Adobe [CEP](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources) using [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). Huge thanks to [Koen Schmeets](https://github.com/vespakoen) for helping out with Webpack.

*NOTE: This is still in progress, but shows off the main features*

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

The bundler will automatically listen for changes and compile. It adds a symlink to the user's extensions folder and sets the debug flags.

## Todo
- [x] Support Extendscript
- [x] Include [Spectrum](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css)
- [x] Extract CSS from `.svelte` files
- [x] Show Svelte features
- [x] Add example component
- [ ] Improve readme
