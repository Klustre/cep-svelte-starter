# CEP Svelte Starter

This is a rudimentary starter for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) in Adobe [CEP](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources) using [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). Huge thanks to [Koen Schmeets](https://github.com/vespakoen) for helping out with Webpack.

*NOTE: This is still in progress; it's buggy and lacks major features*

## Todo
- [x] Support Extendscript
- [x] Include [Spectrum](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css)
- [x] Extract CSS from `.svelte` files
- [ ] Much moreâ€¦

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

The bundler will automatically listen for changes, compile and add a symlink to the user's extensions folder.

## Main Dependencies
