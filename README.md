# CEP Svelte Starter

This is a rudimentary starter for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) in Adobe [CEP](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources) using [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

*NOTE: This is still in progress; it's buggy and lacks major features*

## Todo
- [ ] Support Extendscript
- [ ] Extract CSS from `.svelte` files
- [ ] Much moreâ€¦

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

The bundler will automatically listen for changes, compile and add a symlink to the user's extensions folder.

## Main Dependencies
- [svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte)
- [svelte-loader](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader)
- [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [cep-bundler-webpack](https://github.com/adobe-extension-tools/cep-bundler-webpack)
